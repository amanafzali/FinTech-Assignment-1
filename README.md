Per company blog the technologies they are using are "container orchestration platform is Odin + AWS ASGs (auto-scaling groups). When you click Deploy from Codeflow (our internal UI for deployments), Odin is invoked with an API call from Codeflow. Odin kicks off a step function and begins to deploy your application. New VMs are stood up in AWS and loaded into a new ASG, your software is fetched from various internal locations, a load balancer starts health-checking these new instances, and eventually traffic is cut over in a Blue/Green manner to the new hosts in the new ASG behind the load balancer".

 Coinbase was using Kibana and Amazon Elasticsearch Service at the beginning until late 2017 based on increase of the customers and facing problems with Kibana logs the company settled on Datadog metrics platform. So the company used to use Logs at the beginning but later on when more customers signed up they start using Logs and Metrics, the thoughts were that Metrics should be used for dashboards and alerts and Logs should be used as an investigative tool to find root case of an issue. 

## Recommendations:

As I went through number of Coinbase customers reviews most of them were happy about the services Coinbase provides, just some of the customers had concern about the higher transaction fees they charge specially when they are not in Coinbase pro comparing to other competitors in the market. Also, some like to see more coins available on the platform and more option for payment methods. My recommendation to company will be to listen to their customers, keep in touch with them and evaluate their needs and expectations. Review other companies which they are in the same domain and provide similar services. Based on data and evaluation the company should take some initiatives to meet the highest expectation of their customers.
